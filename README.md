# Block Logins with Cloudflare

Block brute-force login attempts on your WordPress site by integrating with Cloudflareâ€™s firewall API. Automatically block IPs after repeated failed login attempts, manage blocks and whitelists from the admin, and keep your site secure.

## Features

- Block IPs via Cloudflare after configurable failed login attempts
- Automatic unblocking after a configurable duration
- Whitelist IPs to never block or track them
- View and manually unblock blocked IPs from the admin
- Secure settings page with Cloudflare API token validation
- Uses a single serialized option for all settings
- Hourly cron job for automatic maintenance

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.2+
- Cloudflare account with API Token (with Firewall permissions)
- Your site must be proxied through Cloudflare

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin.
3. Go to **Block Logins CF** in the admin sidebar to configure settings.

## Configuration

- **Cloudflare API Token:** Create a token with at least `Zone.Zone` and `Zone.Firewall` permissions.
- **Zone ID:** Find this in your Cloudflare dashboard under your domain's overview.
- **Max Failed Attempts:** Number of failed logins before blocking an IP.
- **Block Duration:** Time window (in seconds) for counting failed attempts.
- **Auto Unblock Duration:** How long (in hours) to keep an IP blocked before automatic unblocking.
- **Whitelist:** Add IPs that should never be blocked or tracked.

## External Services

This plugin relies on the **Cloudflare API** to function. It communicates with Cloudflare's external servers to block IP addresses at the firewall level.

### What is the Cloudflare API and what is it used for?

The Cloudflare API is a RESTful service provided by Cloudflare, Inc. that allows programmatic management of Cloudflare firewall rules. This plugin uses it to automatically block and unblock IP addresses based on failed login attempts.

### What data is sent and when?

The plugin sends the following data to Cloudflare's API servers:

1. **During settings validation** (when you save Cloudflare credentials):
   - Your Cloudflare API token (for verification)
   - Endpoint: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify`

2. **When blocking an IP** (after failed login threshold is reached):
   - The IP address to be blocked
   - Your Cloudflare email address and API key/token
   - Your Cloudflare Zone ID
   - A note describing the reason for the block
   - Endpoint: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/firewall/access_rules/rules`

No personally identifiable information about your WordPress users is transmitted. Only IP addresses of failed login attempts are sent to Cloudflare.

### Service Provider Information

- **Service:** Cloudflare API
- **Provider:** Cloudflare, Inc.
- **Terms of Service:** https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/
- **Privacy Policy:** https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/
- **API Documentation:** https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/

### Required for Functionality

This plugin requires a Cloudflare account and will not function without valid Cloudflare API credentials. The external API calls are essential to the plugin's core functionality.

## Security

- Only administrators (`manage_options`) can access settings and unblock/whitelist IPs.
- All form actions are protected by WordPress nonces.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this block at the Cloudflare level or just WordPress?**  
A: This plugin uses the Cloudflare API to block IPs at the edge, before they reach your server.

**Q: Can I use an API key instead of a token?**  
A: API tokens are recommended for security and are required for the verification feature.
