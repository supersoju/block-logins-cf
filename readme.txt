Block brute-force login attempts by integrating with Cloudflareâ€™s firewall. Automatically block IPs after repeated failed logins, manage blocks and whitelists from the admin, and keep your site secure.

== Description ==

**Block Logins with Cloudflare** helps protect your WordPress site from brute-force attacks by blocking IPs at the Cloudflare firewall after a configurable number of failed login attempts.

- Block IPs via Cloudflare after X failed login attempts
- Automatic unblocking after a configurable duration
- Whitelist IPs to never block or track them
- View and manually unblock blocked IPs from the admin
- Secure settings page with Cloudflare API token validation
- Hourly cron job for automatic maintenance

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/block-logins-cf` directory, or install through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen.
3. Go to **Block Logins CF** in the admin sidebar to configure your Cloudflare credentials and settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What permissions does my Cloudflare API token need? =

= Where do I find my Cloudflare Zone ID? =
In your Cloudflare dashboard, select your domain and look for the Zone ID in the Overview tab.

This plugin blocks IPs at the Cloudflare firewall, stopping attacks before they reach your server.
